sos hey , friend ! 	 39.750841702331925
sos he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age , of unprepossessing countenance , obsequious to his superiors , insolent to his subordinates and this , in addition to his position as responsible agent on board , which is always obnoxious to the sailors , made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dante s was beloved by them . 	 34.14725920866852
sos saved ! 	 29.76012478725334

sos but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope ? 	 65.95331879380255
sos the reason for so publicly announcing all this is , that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits , and , above all , beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance . 	 89.35870074644285
sos it could be seen that she had wished to speak , but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words . 	 32.049820846928576

sos with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand , monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then , opening a casket that stood near , he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold , containing a liquid of the color of blood , of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips . 	 43.4793735127447

sos oh , i assure you , sir , it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures , destined by their talents for higher stations , toiling together , and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house , taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three . 	 53.44797463496931

sos he resolved , then , to defend the door bravely and as , betrayed by the mistress of the inn , he could not say that aramis was absent , he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference , which had commenced with the morning and would not , as bazin said , terminate before night . 	 49.394421558302284
sos so call me merce de s , if you please . 	 24.488527823467948

sos surely , had not such been the case , he would not have perished by so dreadful a death . 	 53.50875500225994

sos then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , the prince and my daughter were universally admired yesterday . 	 73.87714050638384
sos no , replied bonacieux , with a self sufficient air , she is too superficial a woman . 	 26.655498776834996

sos some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel . 	 54.40631471889858
sos asked the abbe smilingly , imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder . 	 24.711635325626613
sos what s the manner ? 	 36.764123570029305

sos the leave of absence monsieur has asked for , replied the lackey . 	 60.16961507452183
sos in fact , m. bonacieux , having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre , never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle , at the expense of his generous eminence . 	 34.84591743797593
sos that was a noble example to follow , monsieur . 	 54.93657471128844
sos this man was dressed in a greatcoat , or rather a surtout , a little worse for the journey , but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant , a decoration which also ornamented the under coat . 	 45.69675123487892

sos olivain was at the same distance in the rear , when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots . 	 40.46980092541942
sos after the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires . 	 38.3124291516329
sos we were then convinced , my friend and i , that there was some error of which we were the victims , and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves . 	 67.43270530982093
sos wait , my dear sir , wait a moment for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait , and i will listen to you afterwards . 	 37.558198333047706
sos then , with renewed instructions to grimaud , athos signified to raoul that he could set out , and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment . 	 50.6412419244054
sos in all probability , this time his master would not retract . 	 19.783410459579162

sos the carriage had started , madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man , and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction . 	 24.965829692330555
sos there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot , or to carry him away , making a buckler of his body , and search him in the trench . 	 37.70722867381099

sos mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint me ran took , and madame de saint me ran is dead . 	 16.3234119507633
sos alas , yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine , and that is faint and flickering , like the light of a lamp about to expire . 	 70.93270598779692
sos by the light of a lamp he saw a woman , wrapped in a dark mantle , seated upon a stool near a dying fire . 	 45.298359027131774
sos this first moment had been delayed five days , which , under any other circumstances , might have appeared rather long to m. bonacieux but he had , in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him , ample subjects for reflection , and as everybody knows , nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection . 	 74.50039050617718
sos i think so , indeed we should be hard to please if we were not . 	 28.709403088042897

sos and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him ? 	 32.479184375335024
sos in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat , between the gendarmes , while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift , and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon . 	 38.06558520116232
sos has he wit or not this demon d artagnan ? 	 61.90859288969568
sos in brief , i regained your harness and then mine . 	 73.92887238324877
sos lord de winter took a chair , drew it toward her , and sat down close beside her . 	 24.807833437141447

sos speak , speak ! 	 21.682452152162906
sos grimaud was still the same , and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior , la ramee , who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself , for , as we have said , la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort . 	 35.78853743810896
sos with albert . 	 72.8640371390549
sos the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed , and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel . 	 42.60013912647899

sos my first visit is due to my father , though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me . 	 25.043944862698524
sos in truth , that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer , was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed , as we have observed , more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers , and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule , which , arising from the streets below , penetrated through the very casements of the room , which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off , happily , without other end or aim , except to show to the guards , the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal , that the people were possessed of arms . 	 82.34943877981729

sos is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for ? 	 84.54770581019469
sos but , replied the owner , glancing after dante s , who was watching the anchoring of his vessel , it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say , danglars , to understand his business , for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly , and not to require instruction from anyone . 	 36.92204343972798
sos and are the first of men ! 	 38.064804712488595
sos but , after all , he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him . 	 58.11859677830557

sos yes , yes , edmond , that is true , but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor , caderousse . 	 24.63198428307194
sos the young woman looked at him furtively . 	 14.544171131053782
sos i must return to the minister s. i will tell him of the count , and we shall soon know who he is . 	 17.887802103302697
sos hell has made you rich , hell has given you another name , hell has almost made you another face but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body . 	 76.71695191068869

sos courage , courage ! 	 51.93590175538119
sos the master of la jeune ame lie , who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value , had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits , which edmond had accepted . 	 41.95623712754206
sos money and sanctity , each in a moiety . 	 44.73529967047295
sos but i excuse it , it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven . 	 30.069081691372723
sos asked the gascon . 	 7.299932418488408

sos tis the same thing you understand me , d artagnan a court . 	 32.25778510664596
sos during the meal , which was excellent , and admirably served , franz looked repeatedly at albert , in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him , whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him , or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone , he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them , but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is , the worst in the world . 	 50.2670031924996

sos as to raoul , he had attended the duchess to her carriage , where , as she took her seat , she gave him her hand to kiss then , by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous , she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead , saying vicomte , may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune ! 	 63.64102589778711

sos aramis accordingly took the quill , reflected for a few moments , wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand , and then with a voice soft and slow , as if each word had been scrupulously weighed , he read the following my lord , the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer . 	 46.736272153973744
sos murmured porthos to himself , and then said aloud , thank you , my cousin , i am no longer hungry . 	 22.15240718239059

sos and he held out his hand . 	 12.651876666470569

sos then in spite of my cries , in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me , threw me on the floor , fastened me with his bonds , and suffocated by sobs , almost without sense , invoking god , who did not listen to me , i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame . 	 54.153945098924815

sos allow me to present you my sincere congratulations , replied madame de villefort . 	 28.640926812680647
sos the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate , to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell . 	 38.27736000075885
sos yes , for you who detest those unhappy princes , beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry . 	 75.49451187581272
sos i felt for it , found it , twisted it up together , and putting it into the expiring flame , set light to it . 	 54.132839226516644
sos it is well , said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible . 	 32.57433796337322

sos lord , how i have eaten ! 	 40.05909655714991
sos while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina , which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces , franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace , for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant . 	 37.09141120556379
sos asked albert , who , being a constant visitor there , did not understand this opposition to his entrance . 	 53.14709618364161
sos come with me , my friend , said the englishman i wish to speak to you . 	 10.187847642653407
sos really , count , you do nothing , and have nothing like other people . 	 51.287476226709444

sos said milady . 	 8.982441527864943
sos the count laughed . 	 11.085048406772572
sos be it so ! 	 36.29979644898345
sos but if it is a woman who writes , said aramis , and that woman desires not to be seen , remember , you compromise her , d artagnan which is not the part of a gentleman . 	 30.921361864692535
sos bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy . 	 45.64925214673008

sos cried she , two thousand livres ! 	 29.838916522790953

sos the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly . 	 33.79322484470129
sos in person . 	 40.2154327845458
sos athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee . 	 40.913179393910255
sos they were yours , you disposed of them according to your fancy , and i asked no questions but it is not the less true that you have this year received , livres . 	 46.77586812775504
sos you are not monte cristo ? 	 18.516210173556633

sos said athos . 	 6.067942124507057
sos he had advanced at first , but stopped at the sight of this display of force . 	 29.077241179151795
sos my brother had arrived the previous evening at ni mes , and , at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality , he had been assassinated . 	 19.80602595891842
sos believe me , madame , as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives that we have , as you well know good heaven ! 	 45.32865226889604
sos a loud laugh followed these words , pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance . 	 69.66786249245075
sos how ? 	 13.539832293783792

sos join the escort ! 	 120.43056012409328
sos ah , you see how it is , said athos , becoming still paler , but yet attempting to laugh i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare . 	 48.348508493532606
sos i also was married at the death bed of my mother , and certainly i have not been less happy on that account . 	 50.878964054374904
sos i would make your fortune . 	 28.51565225223958
sos bonacieux prophesied . 	 34.33797971086751
sos i think not , monsieur , unless something new should happen . 	 55.84125386197298
sos how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo ? 	 23.53890748585353
sos he wore a mask . 	 20.61970195958767
sos left alone , she arose . 	 57.396181653018004
sos well , then , let me have a bottle of the least expensive . 	 13.727756610353245
sos barrois , said valentine , my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire , but there is a secret spring in it , which you know will you open it ? 	 32.59784734946
sos bonacieux , addressing this epithet to her husband . 	 37.66769295766312
sos everything is best in its time , monseigneur . 	 64.15485084995986
sos for a dealer perhaps but for me , who engraved it myself , it is hardly worth a piastre . 	 73.96476766470965
sos asked mazarin , supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands . 	 22.21719009288738
sos those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave . 	 66.96947939940861
sos willingly , monseigneur , said the executioner for as i am a good catholic , i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman . 	 42.8161382086654
sos the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling , dark passage , a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails , like the principal gate of the grand cha telet . 	 90.88274159943624
sos the lackeys followed , armed to the teeth . 	 52.40597516141154
sos god knows , i would prefer sacrificing the whole , so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home . 	 54.036953190867365
sos in consequence he took to his heels , arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door , and knocked violently . 	 32.24736568085364
sos but do you think we shall find the count at home ? 	 16.588427768746076
sos that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and euge nie , as in speaking of the man whom i could not love , my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed . 	 45.3619939079628
sos the return to la rochelle , therefore , was profoundly dull . 	 42.95399632864382
sos it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle , to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham . 	 45.060812319136645
sos adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him . 	 37.53389453615778
sos murmured the young monk , shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired . 	 47.89476254132308
sos then , as i said before , sir , very well i am ready to marry m. cavalcanti . 	 21.26225431946513
sos it was mordaunt . 	 21.220205418382413

sos what , that which brings you home to me ? 	 39.72076253646681
sos i will answer for nothing . 	 14.568058220503945

sos monsieur is , i am sure , an honest man . 	 27.731042194038253
sos bravo ! 	 14.414457928385831
sos and whom i advised you to strangle , porthos , said aramis . 	 22.436661964185685
sos raoul mounted his horse , and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne . 	 23.418008615269507
sos two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling , a table and two benches composed the entire furniture . 	 36.06376150127343
sos asked athos . 	 7.039577954493657
sos on whose side ? 	 35.241290744672845
sos listen , my dear girl , said d artagnan you can not but perceive that all this must end , some way or other . 	 33.71842661453879
sos our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever . 	 91.36378604012641
sos as he said this , he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought . 	 63.53638656993017
sos this time he was both seen and heard , and the tartan instantly steered towards him . 	 46.65110745728298
sos attend to monsieur le cardinal , gentlemen , said d artagnan for myself , i will reconnoitre . 	 15.901086856042241

sos oh , yes , in spite of all i could say . 	 14.869961992718572
sos cried dante s , eagerly quitting the table let us go directly ! 	 36.23980948432226
sos it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league , when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation . 	 42.89869966293978
sos the poor duke swore , fell into a rage , yelled , and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter . 	 43.224284693422646
sos where ? 	 15.034135772440926
sos what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men ? 	 136.47260070421436
sos at these words , moving aside the tapestry , sinbad preceded his guest . 	 64.48012523362256
sos what is the matter ? 	 4.824490804040477
sos d artagnan bent forward , ready either to attack or to stand on his defense . 	 73.53545266872567
sos then her hair assumed successively , under her skillful hands , all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face . 	 95.94618489980527
sos you have seen nothing that resembles him , because he works by secret springs , and moves by hidden ways . 	 93.57810403484645
sos but these two words would bring about my condemnation , divorce , exile ! 	 85.78115920542362
sos possessed by this idea , the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked , however , in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent . 	 59.00943091030501
sos madame , said the viscount of morcerf , advancing towards the countess , yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise , but here is my friend , whose character for veracity you well know , and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine . 	 65.8243469440904
sos enter , my sister , said the queen . 	 13.414300566815184
sos through the darkness franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing , and then , as they rounded a rocky point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated . 	 49.41885215817203
sos he will do anything i wish . 	 25.663940373777834
sos we will dine directly , my friend only you must please to remember that this is friday . 	 33.61403202899929
sos one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon . 	 50.55060050920401
sos my lord duke , tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it ? 	 38.67617767076786
sos but what can i do with you ? 	 10.702748360154574
sos and now , gentlemen , that s well , continued the cardinal . 	 13.345975720538444
sos twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies , and might possibly recognize you and , however i may be honored by your friendship , my worthy friend , if once the extent of our intimacy were known , i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby . 	 93.08047408823383
sos asked aramis . 	 8.048916077640996
sos the other leaned against a tree , supported there by the two valets , and was praying fervently , with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven . 	 43.38943542813267
sos mazarin is almost king , answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen . 	 163.38827401870557

sos the carriage was prepared according to orders , and stepping lightly into it , the count drove off at his usual rapid pace . 	 29.92802601466752
sos come , now , said athos , you are joking . 	 9.505563966929026

sos and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister . 	 40.61788041723075
sos great god ! 	 21.692193676783887
sos where can i sleep ? 	 26.361156815499175

sos well , signor pastrini , said franz , now that my companion is quieted , and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are , tell me who is this luigi vampa . 	 36.57353683647844
sos with a little more heart , he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride . 	 59.814752446711786
sos curiosity that is a terrible word . 	 59.61634167385532
sos the last . 	 50.709238953328075
sos ah ! 	 7.118251367382906
sos you are perfectly right in objecting to them , for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old . 	 49.87419318558209

sos the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel , cried anne , unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor , whom she looked upon , and probably with reason , as the promoter of the tumult . 	 56.22603155942571
sos and the crew ? 	 27.720115379686817
sos you are a provident person , i see . 	 32.87101093168193

sos oh , my god , my god ! 	 4.544701957719957
sos the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m. laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter , and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty . 	 70.0365826942422
sos oh , my heart ! 	 9.095748113491524

sos replied merce de s with a mournful smile . 	 12.831740710992921
sos athos was scarcely aged at all ! 	 118.3621925173318
sos the burning marseilles sun , which shot into the room through the open door , covered them with a flood of light . 	 47.80455755142812
sos maximilian , we said we would be to each other as two voices , two shadows . 	 81.18131610349523

sos it was thought rather dear , but people wanted to sleep , and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep ? 	 89.94830830842096
sos asked albert . 	 8.523044632465814
sos she cried out , but d avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea , he cleared the last four steps with a bound , and rushed into the kitchen , where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter , where it had been left . 	 64.33789519731604
sos he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber , but grated and barred , and its appearance , therefore , did not greatly alarm him besides , the words of villefort , who seemed to interest himself so much , resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom . 	 47.40971256310602
sos sir , i do not deny the justice of your correction , but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man , the more deeply will you strike our family . 	 50.255691014968924
sos at this moment a man entered , without even knocking at the door . 	 15.087350795303465
sos i ? 	 18.568039447194113
sos but then , young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention , then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence , and merited not condemnation . 	 64.36456051113458
sos fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant , who , in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history , was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white , time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow , and his look , once so firm and penetrating , was now irresolute and wandering , as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person . 	 72.67367910682339
sos but without listening to his protestations of alarm , d artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos , who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall . 	 25.56698864742256

sos edmond replied , who knows ? 	 64.23434597037392
sos it was , indeed , the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass , and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison , which could not deceive m. d avrigny , which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven , that , notwithstanding her precautions , there should be some trace , some proof remaining to reveal the crime . 	 52.18767636952194
sos and you see you would have been deceived . 	 18.8829853491322
sos fortunately , as regarded this circumstance at least , his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness , and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory . 	 79.4074588668682

sos the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories but vampa reassured her with a smile , tapping the butt of his good fowling piece , which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage , he pointed to a crow , perched on some dead branch , took aim , touched the trigger , and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree . 	 54.87745642650161
sos morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission . 	 29.54352898669923

sos the young man smiled sorrowfully . 	 11.612320655466235
sos if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine . 	 43.80128198147414
sos in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet , in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain , d artagnan , when awaking on the following morning , had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind . 	 42.86523697754787
sos from the former she took some greasy letters , and put in their place the bank notes , and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each , which , in all probability , formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple . 	 51.01570039360646
sos not to my knowledge . 	 57.48347179342579
sos well , wait for the miracle i hope to accomplish , or or ? 	 68.59257022957642

sos as for me , i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home . 	 58.14775827994123
sos but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened . 	 61.52909631830786
sos there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword , sound trumpets ! 	 158.32706630468562
sos aramis was astonished . 	 29.732550783788504
sos what do you say ? 	 5.155112286206175

sos here are two other cavaliers . 	 48.774807772232215
sos d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea . 	 29.12683038379792
sos suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks , fell upon athos , twined arms of steel around him , and tearing his sword from him , said in his ear silence ! 	 49.086112083714085
sos this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary , while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows , sheathed his sword with the same precision , and instead of an actor , which he had nearly been , became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness , muttering , nevertheless , a plague upon these gascons ! 	 61.240868849355294
sos such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously , and sought out more agreeable companions . 	 61.91623912407707
sos and with us no other escort but you two ? 	 123.5122040784761
sos this threat brought no reply . 	 54.14720581623277
sos i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces . 	 61.718479348243235
sos think not i contented myself with this one effort , continued villefort . 	 58.09512851658999
sos he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse . 	 77.9259227417882
sos your majesty s orders shall be executed but but what ? 	 34.89000216960435
sos in these books , your honor , tis told how hungry voyagers , drifting out to sea , have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them ! 	 114.23981128228988

sos she will be the sooner with her mother . 	 49.537005420131806
sos bonacieux the second time , as he had carried her off the first . 	 30.452576267907887
sos oh , monsieur , said the concierge , i shall not have much cause to regret him , for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last , and he did well to sell the house , for it did not bring him in anything at all . 	 38.45939040821648
sos and how does m. de villefort bear it ? 	 23.506912146504863
sos and me also , said porthos . 	 23.674802724364476
sos there will remain , then , four hundred and fifty pistoles , said d artagnan , contentedly . 	 18.988206811911652
sos m no but the connection will be seen by others , and therefore i will have the article contradicted . 	 52.37772009061608
sos no , monseigneur . 	 10.150923898984974
sos and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile . 	 86.29859028807508
sos hold , sir , said villefort , do not prolong this dreadful scene . 	 19.299472474382895
sos toward the middle of the town , commanding the principal open space , rose a dark mass , separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees . 	 47.43820557965057
sos he was superintending the grooming of his horse , and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden , when the count s carriage stopped at the gate . 	 18.090081554806567
sos hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances , not men . 	 120.8637533854017
sos what do they do ? 	 17.339171940962682
sos replied the king i am bored . 	 21.053738233040008
sos but it s of no importance , continued d artagnan , with natural assurance it s of no importance . 	 42.139945807328466
sos ah , like the charming journey the other day , when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps ! 	 35.60501999537267
sos others proposed the anguille , another kind of recreation , in which a handkerchief is filled with sand , pebbles , and two sous pieces , when they have them , which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer . 	 43.12033492103989
sos well , i will remain with you . 	 13.617591605226503

sos your offer , however , smooths all difficulties , and i have only to ask you , my dear m. de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile , whether you undertake , upon my arrival in france , to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china ? 	 37.871158923719534
sos listen , he said today is the th of september , is it not ? 	 23.924411508147774
sos yes , we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel . 	 90.5346828456289
sos asked the king , looking at the cardinal , who colored with vexation . 	 24.918476351977016
sos i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tre ville s guarantee is more than sufficient . 	 19.762347319062112
sos and that being conducted to the scaffold , resumed the queen oh , my lord ! 	 29.578042257732534
sos these animals , though wild and agile as chamois , were too much like domestic goats , and franz could not consider them as game . 	 60.760232308469746
sos where were we ? 	 35.288189274388714
sos but that is not quite what i mean to ask you , aramis , replied athos . 	 20.539411299322587
sos and what was the end of this worthy man ? 	 14.443499551835725
sos know you again ? 	 55.0519047291637
sos your horses got as far as ranelagh , when they darted forward like mad things , and galloped away at so fearful a rate , that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress , when a strange looking man , an arab , a negro , or a nubian , at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count , whose domestic he is , suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals , even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape . 	 102.05911226489259
sos lieutenant yesterday , said aramis , captain to day , colonel , doubtless , to morrow in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france . 	 45.82388666753546

sos ah , you are there , said she , at length , turning towards fernand . 	 17.55345551341758
sos ah , continued my father , still frowning , their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them food for cannon , which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice , it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain . 	 87.68991145695077
sos asked m. d avrigny , at the foot of the stairs , it being the hour he usually visited her . 	 43.08991481693758
sos said debray , advancing towards the back staircase . 	 23.690832920847935

sos with the queen i double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then , the court once safe , i might be forgotten . 	 193.75212346460665

sos danglars thought of the old man whom , in his hours of delirium , he had seen groaning on his bed . 	 32.91158489909914
sos as to the astute aramis , he did not entertain much dread of him and supposing he should be able to get so far , he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least , by hitting him in the face , as c sar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey , to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud . 	 44.318464064804154
sos perhaps some accident has happened to him . 	 19.66253761373608
sos it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm , that if he had to repay on the th the , francs of m. de boville , and on the th the , francs of bills , for which , as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons , he had time granted , he must be a ruined man . 	 41.62091836519028

sos the history to which m. morrel alludes , continued cha teau renaud , is an admirable one , which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs , and not our memories . 	 39.28992229053616
sos the very circumstances which inflict on you , as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like contentment , and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation . 	 54.35087695004608
sos juxon was waiting for him impatiently . 	 42.39972337634107
sos he will be found . 	 17.624893151909564

sos asked d artagnan . 	 4.309786581225995
sos making a sign to la houdinie re and cahusac to stop , he alighted from his horse , and went toward these suspected merry companions , hoping , by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach , to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting . 	 63.68407165256497
sos the bandits shouted with laughter . 	 42.06661674201371
sos yes . 	 6.402276121533135

sos cried porthos , do you think so ? 	 8.534637238697476
sos during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france , the parisians , finding themselves one morning without either queen or king , were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted , and the absence of mazarin , a thing so long desired , did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives . 	 81.92042647813521
sos this very day . 	 35.75738975429785
sos the pistol fell from his hands . 	 24.185501583105225

sos and now , sir , resumed mousqueton , when he had rid himself of planchet , who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back , now , sir , allow me to leave you , for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you . 	 52.10712356809993

sos i agree , monsieur but do not be too confident . 	 36.37967045616656
sos with the entrance of m. morrel , danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation , and to beseech him to make haste . 	 45.9062934806361

sos said la ramee , scratching his head you are in the wrong to tell me that , my lord . 	 15.270681433620208

sos as for the accused himself , many remembered him as being so amiable , so handsome , and so liberal , that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy , since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy . 	 81.83929438277283
sos that is it , is it not , monseigneur , and i shall have nothing else to do ? 	 15.461930545900028

sos his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness , his perception brightened in a remarkable manner , his senses seemed to redouble their power , the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms , and which he had seen before he slept , but a blue , transparent , unbounded horizon , with all the blue of the ocean , all the spangles of the sun , all the perfumes of the summer breeze then , in the midst of the songs of his sailors , songs so clear and sonorous , that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down , he saw the island of monte cristo , no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves , but as an oasis in the desert then , as his boat drew nearer , the songs became louder , for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven , as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither , or amphion , the enchanter , intended there to build a city . 	 69.91105939208138
sos i thought , i must confess , that these tales , were inventions of the middle ages . 	 24.892242710296514

sos it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it . 	 49.80085631080126
sos you are laughing at me , and want to try me ! 	 36.176531805051326

sos but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head . 	 36.00522903384191

sos d artagnan obeyed , and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact . 	 27.252850966898034
sos i am , sir , said the king , much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques . 	 42.97342795795503

sos you are not convinced yet ? 	 35.22700153679379
sos yes , continued he , a charming woman , who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan , who , on his part , has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots , a week ago by trying to poison him , and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal . 	 55.701503171153725
sos oh , good lord , monsieur chevalier , said she , what are you doing ? 	 10.899333900504972

sos for that night , madame , that night you loved me , i will swear it . 	 27.791531443233943

sos he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary . 	 28.510744041244116
sos his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings , while , with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples . 	 39.18061599718666
sos the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words . 	 67.90791002823325
sos i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible ? 	 40.90327006065265
sos do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment , but which they can take up again instantly , if you attempt to intercept their movements . 	 53.69815528864095

sos franz complimented albert , who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction . 	 26.135927733340417

sos i can tell you but one thing , sir , for the secret you wish to know is not my own . 	 28.511872447093555
sos d artagnan took his hat , examined the hole made by the ball , and shook his head . 	 17.09419883820882
sos oh , i don t doubt that , replied d artagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief , for instance , to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance ? 	 25.447537899553534
sos porthos had six occasions , and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them . 	 72.59363895282802
sos whilst this scene was going on , d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze . 	 66.4518992806123
sos as i have already told you , sir , he was a very dangerous man and , fortunately , by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account . 	 38.009014043871694
sos and you ? 	 12.424910741995985
sos agreed . 	 51.16877097537317

sos the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans , bless with holy water sprinklers , which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers . 	 63.92896474306409
sos meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton , though he did not himself wait on the table , which would have been beneath him in his new position , appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served . 	 62.291796429070686
sos from whom ? 	 15.197629032778902

sos liked a pleasant jest . 	 97.92438643414954
sos athos , on the other hand , reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan . 	 64.01666549850158
sos asked monte cristo , in the same tone that louis xiv . 	 10.892280974403343
sos and when she finally returned , did she bring that casket with her ? 	 87.92190811865906
sos may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit ? 	 40.09094213449739

sos in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter . 	 38.29622816142721
sos great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen , and if talked about , the evil would only recoil upon us . 	 70.37832056121329
sos athos availed himself of the permission , ascended the stairs with his lightest step , gained the landing , and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat . 	 57.46220537009044
sos tell me , valentine for it is that i came to know . 	 23.185526425906023

sos what ? 	 8.27499317291313
sos placed where he was , d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis . 	 25.760264768764447
sos at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london , replied bonacieux , who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets . 	 40.62356535668572
sos and they set out for boulogne , where toward evening they arrived , their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration . 	 57.545671880120636

sos twenty minutes , twenty tedious minutes , passed thus , then ten more , and at last the clock struck the half hour . 	 60.05352821505782
sos when he came within hearing , he exclaimed i am pursued can you conceal me ? 	 115.11785398972339

sos d artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise . 	 19.883587218257798
sos the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man , if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear , and the fine cloth , beneath the careful hands of the prisoner , soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect , for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat . 	 80.80037460486186
sos said caderousse , rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man , i can t keep on my legs ? 	 30.358430503322143

sos all right . 	 106.61942805727692
sos again ! 	 39.49145344496095

sos ah , my young friend , added the curate , groaning , do not regret the devil , i implore you ! 	 21.58868947897388
sos yet , continued the count , becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow , which merce de s had accepted , yet , it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love , or rather delirium . 	 80.40595967893077
sos said the swiss . 	 11.523966621053933

sos and what shall i say to the people ? 	 13.42977607124215

sos no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her , while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent , and after a mere bow , monte cristo directed his steps to albert , who received him cordially . 	 40.128677429250764
sos very well and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary , which said , i have no further need of you you may go . 	 27.705242533361456

sos still , in spite of this , albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but , alas , his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away , and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure . 	 70.33480799704938
sos what was it then ? 	 12.996636456968904
