sos this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais , who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards , because it would be an enemy the less , and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket . 	 61.33078911357363

sos sometimes when the cardinal , always on horseback , like the lowest gendarme of the army , cast a pensive glance over those works , so slowly keeping pace with his wishes , which the unk , brought from all the corners of france , were executing under his orders , if he met a musketeer of the company of tre ville , he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner , and not recognizing in him one of our four companions , he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction . 	 111.69811255704727

sos the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested . 	 57.5916520969598
sos we have no need , therefore , to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation , only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears , stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal unk , he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his unk to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place . 	 158.5536414600953
sos said d artagnan , and that comes very ill from you , who have never loved . 	 43.42831843225501

sos until saturday , when i may expect you , may i not ? 	 103.78526145298906
sos he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome , although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty . 	 397.38581187631064
sos asked athos . 	 7.039577954493657
sos there were nobles , who made war against each other there was the king , who made war against the cardinal there was spain , which made war against the king . 	 104.53743037918363

sos while unk the past , i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner . 	 372.7231697450204
sos luigi vampa comes to take us , and we take him we bring him back to rome , and present him to his holiness the pope , who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses , and we see the carnival in the carriage , and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol , and proclaim us , like unk and unk cocles , the unk of their country . 	 171.73985053759372
sos then , with a hasty movement , he tore open his coat , which seemed to stifle him , and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor , then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away . 	 80.76897987948013
sos all my hopes are blighted , my heart is broken , my life a burden , everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become unk to me , and human voices distract me . 	 235.80125969140775

sos and you would have flattered him , for certainly , as you say , he has no manner . 	 42.78744247513412

sos have you seen anything ? 	 12.47533982134396

sos upon my word , the drum draws near , said d artagnan . 	 46.19454243101178

sos anne blushed and buried her face in her hands . 	 41.80699616169733

sos may i congratulate you ? 	 28.84703287698178
sos but , as we have said , bazin had not , by his fortunate return , removed more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends . 	 68.69469353392857
sos yes , yes , said de guiche , a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale , the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites , and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy , but they have lost . 	 577.5944257360693
sos porthos devoured d artagnan with wondering eyes . 	 185.12807415155612

sos they never overtook the chimerical friend , yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the unk which were not yet closed , for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many unk to be seen on the road to the low countries , and as nine unk of them are green , the inquiries increased at every step . 	 488.13839633377575

sos athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan , approached the lamp , set fire to the paper , and did not let go till it was reduced to a unk . 	 53.30900217038356
sos duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week , about one o clock , at the residence of athos , seeing that he , in agreement with the vow he had formed , did not pass over the threshold of his door . 	 135.53316953259542
sos his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself , and he will deliver the official order to the officer , who , in his turn , will hand it to the executioner in the meantime , it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on , if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses , because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred . 	 117.76398328498021
sos follow my advice , swear , and do not insult . 	 95.37481959634333
sos he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep , and having found his diamond ring on his finger , his purse in his pocket , and his pistols in his belt , he rose , paid for his bottle , and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before . 	 70.37362245825855
sos therefore , in spite of all my protestations , if it be as i suspect , my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror . 	 80.06629175772423
sos but don t let us hinder you , mousqueton go and perform your master s orders . 	 81.24757639832714
sos it was quite evident , by her manner , that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him , as it arose from a variety of unk recollections , while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief , originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths . 	 215.09348964345574
sos that s what i call love ! 	 58.61977526953887

sos nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear but when poor , silly folks , like my husband there , have been persuaded to tell all they know , the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some moment when nobody is expecting it , behold trouble and misery , and all sorts of persecutions , are heaped on the unfortunate wretches , who can not even see whence all their afflictions come . 	 344.24624546864936
sos adieu , gentlemen , said de comminges sleep well ! 	 50.288052534092

sos this noirtier was his father ! 	 66.12206946627026

sos said noirtier and why , then , have they not laid hands on him ? 	 67.5419901794243
sos these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time , and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long . 	 405.37216248744585
sos at this instant m. de tre ville entered , cool , polite , and in irreproachable costume . 	 35.33464474613306
sos fernand went , and merce de s remained alone . 	 29.192410414068494

sos good enough ! 	 37.040049646943615
sos i claim , then , the right to choose my opponent . 	 82.5156676222447
sos long live de beaufort ! 	 253.19046139999708
sos unfortunately , edmond is dead , and has not pardoned me . 	 31.28228037496887
sos alas ! 	 11.927666488496964
sos the major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to compose his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an under look at the count , the unk smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity . 	 148.57814229432253
sos if i judge for myself , my lord , she said , the cardinal will do nothing , and will even , perhaps , act against us . 	 36.234392456308534
sos he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep , locked , bolted , fastened in the wall a coffer of which he had so often heard , and which the hands a little wrinkled , it is true , but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks . 	 142.41766969729804
sos merce de s extended her hand to the count . 	 13.110005298128176
sos once outside the city , d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood . 	 115.23307601722759
sos on leaving paris , athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger . 	 110.39673748776109
sos well , then , said milady , i confide in my brother i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself , as on the preceding day , with passing before the door and going away again . 	 50.01060193200278
sos yes , monseigneur , said d artagnan . 	 5.724584273605539
sos since , in our romance of the three musketeers , we took leave of d artagnan at no . 	 71.90321702521172
sos from her majesty ! 	 52.51628059380358
sos keep your secret , young man , and tell me what you wish . 	 29.67486859399339
sos formerly , said the count , i was athos . 	 25.353096131024575
sos you might as well have tried to stop number three of the unk , who gained the prize in the race today , replied franz and then moreover , what could happen to him ? 	 165.50890524987895
sos yes , i will tell you all but take away the young man i can not endure his presence . 	 24.35552103019232
sos aramis shook his head . 	 9.7565056906512
sos said d artagnan , bowing to the officer . 	 9.190132463274129
sos when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern , without a name and without a sign a mere fisherman s hut . 	 128.5572414320773
sos inquired valentine , uneasily . 	 25.93689556936241
sos twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is , until nine the next morning . 	 181.27808513355677
sos athos sprang from his horse , gave the bridle to grimaud , and advanced toward the window , after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door . 	 19.98437129677649
sos the abbe rose , took his hat and gloves . 	 21.272755466196074
sos asked monte cristo . 	 5.374106594585931
sos they may not be so very great . 	 40.82337122979883
sos you would expose the self love of another with a unk , but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle . 	 231.9026502768749
sos gone , never to return ! 	 90.17699147158474
sos you are the son of the unk cavalcanti and the unk oliva corsinari . 	 185.10891926256878
sos andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad , and he feared to utter some unk before so many grand people , amongst whom , with unk eyes , he saw the king s attorney . 	 205.693346753911
sos as to lord de winter , he descended the stairs rapidly , and went straight to the port . 	 21.529008626919225
sos we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms , under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious , or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which , from caprice , discontent , or want of fortune , they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform . 	 306.03561285229495
sos you know , athos , you never spoke much of such matters . 	 32.54202278217394
sos he wishes to have you in his service . 	 26.336003725167508
sos my uncle , answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family . 	 119.20221341716244
sos aramis smiled as one who hopes . 	 169.15428280033277
sos may i , at least , return ? 	 39.43722920101879
sos and he extended his hands toward grimaud , who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him . 	 55.02605376864032
sos said the count . 	 5.441916274324647
sos a wealthy signor , who travels for his pleasure . 	 377.72086262942037
sos gentlemen , said he , you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence . 	 21.889177492977108
sos oh , yes , it is she ! 	 13.309595495671209
sos in the first place , you will sup with me , will you not ? 	 13.097330590547287
sos whether queens or not , they are always the same . 	 137.14668210829518
sos and moreover , my dear child , continued d artagnan , i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian . 	 54.1952382815955
sos he said . 	 9.532605358655347
sos i must then place my life , my honor , my reputation , in your hands ? 	 37.15395935534321
sos that dear protector , said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly ? 	 87.11564761400999
sos and gondy , in unk and cloak , appeared , moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his unk to the right and left , as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu . 	 355.28406483370355
sos in order to make one s way amid these unk and conflicting waves , it was necessary to be an officer , a great noble , or a pretty woman . 	 116.11847607009337
sos a count , and a rich one too , eh ? 	 87.05472977562448
sos richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man . 	 29.42596424910925
sos said mazarin , writhing beneath this simple eloquence , your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly , and that is partly because , doubtless , i explain myself in french . 	 180.2386948467161
sos unk ! 	 741.3100371477314
sos what is it ? 	 5.102681095549564
sos it is not for herself that she is so , but for her son , and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love . 	 105.13621006655868
sos porthos rested his chin on his hands , placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that unk an admirable appearance of good fellowship . 	 99.58521008390863
sos yes i have parted with him . 	 33.83972113324009
sos we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health , d artagnan . 	 59.29258436400116
sos why are the glass and decanter empty ? 	 487.31116176842795
sos unlike other men , who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches , the duc de beaufort , whose unk courage had become a proverb , seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action . 	 359.87782499892313
sos it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin . 	 87.97462292733897
sos and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent , his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy . 	 47.82996931883658
sos d artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said , i ask alms of no man . 	 76.71124540997464
sos comminges , wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead , had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal , followed by a menacing crowd , to tell his story . 	 58.683652614338946
sos besides , you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort . 	 23.769333335492153
sos well , then , at the end of a month , when drinking water from the same carafe , you would kill the person who drank with you , without your perceiving , otherwise than from slight inconvenience , that there was any unk substance mingled with this water . 	 186.17089086378508
sos but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor . 	 42.711815585743246
sos will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs ? 	 151.30910228754743
sos i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me , and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris ? 	 78.09435582315156
sos and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself , grimaud set off at full speed whilst , enchanted at being all together again , the friends awaited his return . 	 197.9045914608392
sos but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say , with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her , in exchange for the precarious and unk royalty of paris , the unk of font de l arche , in other words , of all normandy when he had unk in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font , madame de longueville contended no longer , except as is the custom with pretty women to contend , and defended herself only to surrender at last . 	 189.93993987354506
sos as we have said , he was lying on the deck . 	 17.40525521327535
sos then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman , like athos the second a good soldier , like porthos the third an excellent abbe , like aramis . 	 189.04143948457673
sos porthos tried , and passed the upper portion of his body through . 	 111.62846782989428
sos yes but first give me this letter . 	 42.37186234702319
sos the author of this history , who has resided five or six years in italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries . 	 97.40499074676673
sos whilst this went on , porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face , and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry . 	 162.61444432776912
sos so then so then , pack up our luggage , planchet , and let us be off . 	 119.34189434198261
sos i only know one thing i dislike more , which is the sound of your voice . 	 74.49527514595401
sos adieu , gentlemen ! 	 15.271751870501719
sos the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker . 	 186.44611346793914
sos therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m. de tre ville , confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure , when the news was unk to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers , and that they formed part of the escort . 	 53.04568363694405
sos but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , added he , drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies , i shall endeavor to correct his mistake . 	 109.8617812427278
sos . 	 40.78305738837434
sos i hope , said d artagnan , half dead with fright , you made no mention of my diamond ? 	 47.484871574610246
sos athos made him a sign to come with them . 	 18.494476576996014
sos if you will only agree to my request , i promise you never to mention another word about escaping . 	 66.48140617981443
sos exactly . 	 23.86674498573313
sos my mother was a christian , and she prayed . 	 42.631209532039996
sos a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are , if he opens communication with us , before long athos will act . 	 247.27024167997092
sos i have heard talk of him . 	 25.118896581358324
sos as all this , however , bore some resemblance to a duel , d artagnan began to recover himself little by little . 	 111.47989930045789
sos the lackey bowed and let them pass . 	 36.35952728675901
sos several unk were visited by them , several innkeepers questioned , without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries , when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers . 	 823.5277919887626
sos cried milady . 	 8.592939649420215
sos haste ! 	 90.04516471878397
sos i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged . 	 128.06899001873094
sos said felton . 	 8.804648808836614
sos these were pistols of an especial pattern , which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room . 	 224.27720405662987
sos now , said he , will you come ? 	 10.937793366565703
sos the aldermen did as they had done before , and preceded by their sergeants , advanced to receive their illustrious guest . 	 134.33654571353625
sos the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that cha teau renaud did not seek to unk him , and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion . 	 145.01029403947697
sos the young woman in the street replied by a single tap , and the shutter was opened a little way . 	 55.54501617563965
sos if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence , we are ready to obey you . 	 37.036120044382415
sos he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared . 	 203.23258901344113
sos not a bad idea ! 	 39.19788268353305
sos your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want . 	 79.03793152723263
sos inquired mordaunt . 	 21.493205546383084
sos unk are deceptive . 	 6378.807619993269
sos said dante s , staggered at the enormous amount . 	 79.87177946222513
sos but i give you warning that if in unk your chapel unk you forget how to unk up my sword , i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it . 	 440.006128105312
sos i was like you , and had a king in keeping . 	 72.3248304927783
sos exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room . 	 97.77503299673104
sos if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments , i could even thank you for unk me , for it leaves me a gleam of hope , that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose , at least i was in your thoughts . 	 117.00772204610854
sos fly , fly ! 	 76.8928908416511
sos and this room ? 	 56.05681651317454

sos am i to be captured ? 	 146.8150878487243
sos a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this moment , albert , had nothing more transpired , your father s cause had been gained . 	 97.13791964883117
sos but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second , than , for fear he should make a third , he is struck down . 	 110.71161196479152
sos on this paved yard are to be seen , pacing to and fro from morning till night , pale , careworn , and haggard , like so many shadows , the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is unk . 	 323.7137193164409
sos said caderousse , supported by a supernatural power , and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who , then , are you ? 	 143.985999921546
sos then , said merce de s , i will lead the way . 	 17.42251837191948
sos i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow . 	 85.64726347480931
sos all this was answered by an expression of d artagnan s. tomorrow , said he , you will be avenged , or i shall be dead . 	 31.010132704946457
sos can he be inconstant before being happy ? 	 314.0793653904757
sos albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter . 	 95.17655883236647
sos yes , madame . 	 8.866427538355493
sos these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan , who urged his horse , though he stood in need of no unk , and they proceeded at a rapid pace . 	 53.50536161982844
sos shall i tell him that he can count on you ? 	 39.46459075910606
sos when he had finished with the orange tree , he began at the unk but this , not being so easily unk as the orange tree , pricked him dreadfully . 	 183.51466426498413
sos and in that case , how shall i know where you are ? 	 15.018766483586495
sos i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head . 	 23.20027944880336
sos it was an impossibility for the last week m. de villefort has secluded himself . 	 143.06189087300564
sos and the young girl , kneeling on the top , pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together , and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through . 	 92.75442294744555
sos then , said the abbe , we may hope to put our design into execution . 	 40.34431124000652
sos he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased . 	 182.96934732364886

sos she opened the door . 	 12.433706047671615
sos remember , answered the abbe calmly , as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock , it is your fault , not mine , that i do so . 	 72.44180198809899
sos at length , he one day received a letter , unk that the unk of his son now offered to restore him , or at least to give notice where he might be found , on condition of receiving a large sum of money , by way of ransom . 	 110.90838183174193

sos in whom can i trust ? 	 53.589289739238005

sos if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah , true , observed monte cristo i recollect now . 	 88.50904107278677
sos while his eminence was seeking for me in paris , i would take , without sound of drum or trumpet , the road to picardy , and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions . 	 71.01230313346386
sos morrel went also to the notary , who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening . 	 41.75446026264047
sos beauty has always been and always will be all powerful . 	 255.07820556134467

sos cried the three musketeers all together , on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger . 	 96.32538210157183
sos but was it on her own account , or on account of another , that she exposed herself to such unk ? 	 92.48431393488605

sos cried he , and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence , tell her what you have seen . 	 23.830093641281795
sos i crossed the street , and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall , and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden . 	 38.98397050447239

sos the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows , then returned , and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations , and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the unk , expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted . 	 379.66547024396095
sos i gave him the helm , and descended there was already three feet of water . 	 49.40071063516939

sos he gave no other name , answered julie , looking earnestly at the count , than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor . 	 39.239005764238

sos listen to me , rather than add to my destruction , rather than add to my ignominy ! 	 171.21441833062184
sos thus the count was unk turned towards his visitor , having his back towards the window , his elbow resting on the unk chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment , a conversation which assumed , as in the case of the unk with danglars and morcerf , a turn unk to the persons , if not to the situation . 	 281.55691339591306
sos he said . 	 9.532605358655347

sos then all looked at each other , he was made to take an oath , and did so , but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus , and yet , in spite of that , the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free . 	 77.55023519176716
sos the officer looked at me with astonishment , and then said , what is your business with me , monsieur ? 	 21.486037734894808
sos no , no i am here , said the monk , quickly coming back to him . 	 25.105179960377072

sos so long as you are rich ! 	 23.994496636074857

sos must this last formality take place in your presence , sir ? 	 66.1012632970218
